# Changelog

Notable changes to Worktree Kanban (named Agent Kanban before 0.1.84). This file is a summary, grouped by version range. The notes for every single version, with download links, are on the [Releases](https://github.com/kazuya83/worktree-kanban/releases) page.

Each release that changes the app raises the last number of the version. There is no separate compatibility promise while the version is 0.x.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Use from your phone: from anywhere, see the board in a phone browser (iPhone and Android), create and start tasks, send follow-up instructions, approve, and answer questions. The app starts Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`, Quick Tunnel or a named tunnel), so no port forwarding is needed. Phones pair with a one-time QR code, tokens expire after 30 days, and each phone can be revoked. Merging, PRs, and settings are not available from the phone. The phone page uses a versioned HTTP API (`/api/v1`) that a future native app can also use.
- The agent selected by default for new tasks and conversations can now be one of the project's custom agents, and it is remembered per project. Existing projects keep the value used so far. If the chosen custom agent is deleted or its base agent is unchecked, the first of the agents to use is selected.
- A guide for moving from Conductor, with the steps to export Conductor Cloud data first (English and Japanese).
- Headless mode (`--headless`): keeps the scheduler, Issue watching, Slack, the remote control host, and the mobile page running without a window, including on a Linux server with no display. Approvals and questions wait until answered and are posted to Slack. Tokens can come from environment variables or a token file readable only by you (`chmod 600`). The desktop app and headless mode refuse to run at the same time on one machine. A Linux `tar.gz` with a `worktree-kanban-headless` launcher is added to the release files. See [docs/headless.md](docs/headless.md).

### Security

- Tasks created from Issues and tasks requested from Slack, including their subtasks and relay branches, never run with "Allow everything automatically". They run with `acceptEdits` (file edits automatic, commands need approval) even when the project's permission mode is `bypassPermissions`, so a malicious Issue cannot run commands without approval. The card log says so when this applies.

## 0.1.96

### Changed

- Clicking outside the detail panel, on its left, closes it.

## 0.1.95

### Added

- Integrations with GitLab, Linear, and Jira, including self-hosted GitLab and Jira Data Center: create tasks from Issue numbers or URLs, link Issues in PRs and MRs, sync status with the card, write comments back, and handle sub-issues.
- GitLab merge requests: create them, check conflicts and pipeline results, and detect merges.
- Slack integration: notifications for completions, failures, and items waiting for you, and starting tasks from Slack for allowed users only. Nobody can start a task by default.
- Approving and answering from Slack: buttons on notifications for permission checks, agent questions, spec checks, and replies, limited to allowed users. Slack offers Allow only when the full tool input can be shown. Needs "Interactivity & Shortcuts" turned on in the Slack app.
- An "Integrations" section in Settings. Tokens are encrypted with a key from the OS secure storage.
- In-card approval for Codex (`codex app-server`) and Cursor (`cursor-agent acp`). Versions that do not support it keep the previous behavior.
